# Boing

Boing is a Java dependency injection tool written in Clojure. The main motivation behind
this initiative was a need to get away from Spring beans and all the dependencies that it
carries. Hence the name... if you have better suggestions, they are welcomed.


Usage help will follow, we are still working on the context management. Expect also
examples to illustrate how it can be used.
